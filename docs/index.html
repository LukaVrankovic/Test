                <h2>Summer School Program</h2>
                <p>Live Immersive Programming with Pharo</p>
                <p>Keyworks: Reflective, OO design, IA, XTDD, Visualization, Scripting C libraries, Live coding,
                    Mastering your debugger</p>
                <h3>Day One: Pharo in one Day</h3>
                <p>During this day you will learn the survival kit to code in Pharo. You will learn the syntax and the
                    main tools to code and publish code. After that day you will be able to code in Pharo. Yes the
                    syntax fits in half of a postcard.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pharo for the scientists</li>
                    <li>Discover and experience eXTreme Test Driven Design</li>
                    <li>Hands-on with ProfStef</li>
                    <li>Understand the key tools for coding, debugging, inspecting and publishing code</li>
                    <li>Handon: coding the counter</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Day Two: Crafting user interfaces</h3>
                <p>During this day you will learn how to define user interfaces using the Spec UI builder framework. We
                    will also show you how to extend tools to shape them to your own needs. We will also build a simple
                    web server in a couple of pages to revisit the Pharo syntax. You will see how you can build
                    nontrivial programs in an immersed way by interacting with life objects.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple tour of Spec</li>
                    <li>Build a little App with Spec todo App in 15 min</li>
                    <li>Tools are shaping your mind: Define your own tool. Extend the environment Graph inspector</li>
                    <li>Revisit the syntax building a web server</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Day Three: IA with Pharo</h3>
                <p>During that day we will focus on AI and visualization. You will learn about DataFrame (how to grab,
                    and collect data), train a model and validate your results. We will show how you can understand your
                    data and results using the Roassal scripting visualization engine available from <a
                        href="http://agilevisualization.com">http://agilevisualization.com.</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting started with machine learning</li>
                    <li>TeaLight and machine learning: you will connect a web server to machine learning</li>
                    <li>Data Frame.</li>
                    <li>Train a model.</li>
                    <li>Validate a model.</li>
                    <li>Using live visualization scripting of Roassal <a
                            href="http://agilevisualization.com">http://agilevisualization.com</a> to script interactive
                        visualization.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Day Four: Object-oriented Design and Software Engineering</h3>
                <p>During this day you will rethink your OO understanding. At the end of this day, you will not think or
                    program object-oriented the same way. Experts in object-oriented design will give you keys that will
                    change how you will code in any object-oriented language in the future. We will also present
                    advanced software engineering techniques. Finally, we will show you how we can script VLC from Pharo
                    using native calls.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rethink your OOP skills: Understand late binding for real.</li>
                    <li>Advanced Tools: Automatic Rewriting, Refactorings, Finder.</li>
                    <li>Scripting VLC from Pharo.</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Day Five: Code Analysis</h3>
                <p>During this day we will present the Moose <a
                        href="http://modularMoose.org">http://modularMoose.org</a> is a powerful platform to define and
                    apply software analyses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will define a meta-model to represent commits, files, and authors.</li>
                    <li>You will define specific visualizations in Roassal to display information.</li>
                </ul>
