                <h2>About the city of Split</h2>
                <p>The story of Split is already 17 centuries old, dating to the time the Roman Emperor Diocletian
                    decided to build his Palace right on the peninsula near the great Roman city Salona, where he wanted
                    to spend the last years of his life. During these 1700 years the Palace slowly turned into a city,
                    which to this day lures with its rich tradition, glorious history and beauty of its natural and
                    cultural heritage.<br>
                    Diocletian Palace and the entire historical core of Split have been on the World Heritage UNESCO
                    list ever since 1979, and not only for the extraordinary preservation of the Palace, but also
                    because the Palace and its city (or the city and its Palace, if you like) continue to live a full
                    life. All historical layers from the old Rome, middle ages till today are still visible and alive in
                    this structure. A walk through the ancient city takes you through time, along the great examples of
                    ancient architecture like Peristyle, the middle-aged Romanesque Church and Gothic Palace,
                    Renaissance portals of the noblemen’s houses, Baroque facades, and modern architecture superbly
                    merged in the rich heritage.<br Split is much more than glorious architectural scenery. Split is
                        also a venue for excellent gourmet and vine experiences, numerous cultural happenings like film
                        and theatre festivals, exhibitions, excellent museums, and concerts, a city that offers eclectic
                        modes of entertainment starting with numerous clubs and bars, through street festivals to events
                        such as Ultra Europe Festival visited each year by up to 100 thousand young people from around
                        one hundred countries of the world. Split with its sport results is something only a handful of
                        cities of similar size around the world can boast about as it is the home of a dozen Olympic
                        medal winners as well as other sports medals.<br>
                    When you tire of the city bustle, there’s Marjan, a hill symbol over the city, with its forest,
                    jogging trails, mountain climbing and biking, recreational terrains, but also the ancient churches
                    where the late citizens of Split sought spiritual peace. Also very unusual to find in a city the
                    size of Split are the numerous beaches with extraordinarily clean sea, from the well-known Bačvice
                    to the stone secluded oases’ all around Marjan.<br>
